To be more precise, it works like this:\n  - Find all `package.json` files.\n  - Find the greatest version of in those `package.json` files.\n  - Increment the PATCH part of that version.\n  - Set that incremented version to EVERY `package.json` (every project will be published with the same version).\n- Build all publishable projects.\n- Publish all publishable projects.",
